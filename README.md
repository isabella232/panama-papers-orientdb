## Introduction

Hello and welcome to the panama-papers-orientdb repository!

The aim of this repository is to make the Panama Papers database available in OrientDB, the Graph/Document Multi-Model Database

We have imported the Panama Papers database into OrientDB using the [Neo4j to OrientDB Importer](http://orientdb.com/neo4j-to-orientdb-importer/)

Please open an issue if you have any questions or problems

Many thanks,
